- User behavior insights

### 6. Recommendation Caching Strategy
- User-specific recommendation caching (1 hour)
- Cache invalidation on user activity
- Performance optimization
- Memory usage management
- Cache warming strategies
- Stale data handling

### 7. Response Formatting
- Structured recommendation response
- Book information inclusion
- Recommendation reasoning
- Confidence scoring
- Generation metadata
- User preference insights

### 8. Error Handling and Resilience
- OpenAI API failure handling
- Network timeout management
- Graceful degradation to fallback
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic implementation
- Service availability monitoring

### 9. Performance Optimization
- Asynchronous API calls
- Response time optimization
- Efficient user data retrieval
- Recommendation pre-computation
- Background processing consideration
- Resource usage monitoring

### 10. Security and Privacy
- API key protection
- User data privacy in prompts
- Secure API communication
- Data anonymization
- Usage tracking and limits
- Compliance considerations

## OpenAI Integration Details

### Prompt Structure:
```typescript
// Example prompt template
const prompt = `
Based on the following user preferences, recommend 3 books:

User's Favorite Genres: ${favoriteGenres.join(', ')}
Recent High-Rated Books: ${highRatedBooks.map(b => `${b.title} by ${b.author}`).join(', ')}
Average Rating Given: ${averageRating}

Please provide 3 book recommendations with:
1. Title and Author
2. Brief reason why it matches user preferences
3. Confidence score (0.0-1.0)

Format as JSON array.
`;
```

### Response Processing:
- Parse JSON response from OpenAI
- Validate recommendation structure
- Match recommended books with database
- Calculate confidence scores
- Format for API response

## Fallback Algorithm

### Recommendation Logic:
1. **Genre-based**: Books from user's favorite genres
2. **Rating-based**: Highly rated books user hasn't reviewed
3. **Popular**: Most reviewed books in preferred genres
4. **Similar users**: Books liked by users with similar preferences

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AI recommendations are generated successfully
- [ ] Fallback system works when AI is unavailable
- [ ] Recommendations are personalized based on user data
- [ ] Caching improves response times significantly
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful degradation
- [ ] User preferences are analyzed accurately
- [ ] Recommendation reasons are meaningful
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<2s including AI call)
- [ ] Security measures protect API keys and user data
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- [ ] Recommendations are diverse and relevant

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Task 002: Database Setup and Models
- Task 003: Authentication and Authorization
- Task 004: Books API Endpoints
- Task 005: Reviews API Endpoints
- Task 006: Favorites API Endpoints

## Estimated Time
12-15 hours

## Notes
- Obtain OpenAI API key and set up billing
- Implement comprehensive error handling for external API
- Consider implementing recommendation feedback system
- Add analytics for recommendation effectiveness
- Test with various user preference patterns
- Consider implementing A/B testing for recommendation algorithms
- Plan for scaling recommendation generation
- Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring
