## Overview
Implement user favorites functionality allowing authenticated users to add, remove, and manage their favorite books.

## Scope

- Include complete book information
- Sort by creation date (newest first)
- Proper pagination metadata

### 2. POST /favorites - Add to Favorites Endpoint
- Authenticated endpoint (JWT required)
- Request validation:
  - `bookId` (UUID, required, must exist)
- Business logic:
  - Duplicate prevention (one favorite per user per book)
  - Book existence validation
  - Automatic timestamp generation
- Response: Created favorite with 201 status

### 3. DELETE /favorites/{bookId} - Remove from Favorites Endpoint
- Authenticated endpoint (JWT required)
- Path parameter validation:

  - Remove favorite if exists
  - Handle non-existent favorites gracefully
  - User authorization (own favorites only)
- Response: Success confirmation with 200 status

### 4. Favorites Validation Service
- Book ID validation and existence check
- Duplicate favorite prevention
- User authorization validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Error handling for invalid requests

### 5. Favorites Business Logic
- Unique constraint enforcement (userId + bookId)
- Efficient favorite checking
- Bulk operations support (future consideration)
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- Transaction support for data consistency

### 6. Response Formatting
- Consistent JSON structure
- Complete book information inclusion
- Favorite metadata (creation date)
- Pagination information
- Error response standardization

### 7. Database Operations
- Efficient queries for favorites listing
- Proper indexing utilization
- Compound index on (userId, bookId)
- Optimized book data population
- Performance monitoring

### 8. Authorization Implementation
- JWT token validation
- User context extraction
- Ownership verification
- Permission checking
- Unauthorized access prevention

### 9. Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization
- Proper indexing strategy
- Efficient pagination
- Book data population optimization
- Caching considerations

### 10. Error Handling
- Book not found scenarios
- Duplicate favorite attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
