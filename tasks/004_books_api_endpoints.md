# Task 004: Books API Endpoints

## Overview
Implement all book-related API endpoints including listing, search, filtering, sorting, and detailed book information retrieval.

## Scope
- Book listing with pagination
- Search functionality
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Book detail retrieval
- Genre management
- Book reviews endpoint

## Deliverables

### 1. GET /books - Book Listing Endpoint
- Paginated book listing (default: 12 per page, max: 50)
- Query parameter support:
  - `page` (integer, default: 1)
  - `limit` (integer, default: 12, max: 50)
  - `search` (string) - search by title or author
  - `genres` (array) - filter by genres
  - `sort` (string) - sorting options
  - `author` (string) - filter by specific author
  - `minRating` (decimal) - minimum rating filter
  - `publishedYear` (integer) - publication year filter

### 2. Search Implementation
- Full-text search on title and author fields
- Case-insensitive search
- Partial matching support
- Search result ranking by relevance
- Search performance optimization

### 3. Filtering Capabilities
- Genre-based filtering (multiple genres support)
- Author filtering
- Publication year filtering
- Rating-based filtering (minimum rating)
- Combination of multiple filters

### 4. Sorting Options Implementation
- `newest` - Sort by creation date (newest first)
- `oldest` - Sort by creation date (oldest first)
- `rating` - Sort by average rating (highest first)
- `rating_low` - Sort by average rating (lowest first)
- `reviews` - Sort by review count (most reviewed first)
- `title` - Sort alphabetically by title
- `author` - Sort alphabetically by author

### 5. GET /books/{bookId} - Book Detail Endpoint
- Retrieve detailed book information
- Include all book fields
- Validate book ID format (UUID)
- Handle non-existent book IDs
- Return comprehensive book data

### 6. GET /books/{bookId}/reviews - Book Reviews Endpoint
- Paginated reviews for specific book
- Query parameters:
  - `page` (integer, default: 1)
  - `limit` (integer, default: 10, max: 50)
  - `sort` (string) - newest, oldest, rating_high, rating_low
- Include reviewer information (name only)
- Proper pagination metadata

### 7. GET /books/genres - Genres Endpoint
- Return list of available genres
- Static genre taxonomy
- Cached response for performance
- Consistent genre naming

### 8. Response Formatting
- Consistent JSON response structure
- Proper pagination metadata
- Error handling for all scenarios
- Performance optimization

### 9. Caching Strategy
- Book listings cache (5 minutes)
- Book details cache (15 minutes)
- Genres cache (1 hour)
- Search results cache (10 minutes)
- Cache invalidation on data updates

### 10. Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization
- Proper indexing utilization
- Response compression
- Efficient pagination
- Query result limiting
