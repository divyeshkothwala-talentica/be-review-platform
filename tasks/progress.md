### Quality Standards
- All code must pass linting and formatting checks
- Unit tests required for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Documentation must be updated for any API changes
- Security best practices must be followed

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **OpenAI API Integration**: External dependency that could affect recommendations
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization critical for search functionality
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication and authorization must be bulletproof

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement fallback mechanisms for external services
- Performance testing and optimization from early stages
- Security review and testing throughout development
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Response Times**: All endpoints < 500ms (cached < 100ms)
- **Uptime**: > 99% availability
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% code coverage
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of requests

### Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: Functional registration flow
- **Review Creation**: Users can create and manage reviews
- **Search Performance**: Fast and relevant book search
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions working

## Notes and Considerations

### Development Environment
- Use Docker for consistent development environment
- Set up proper environment variable management
- Implement hot reloading for development efficiency

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency

- Proper logging throughout the application

### Performance Considerations
- Implement caching early in development
- Monitor database query performance
- Use proper indexing strategies
- Consider pagination for all list endpoints

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets to version control
