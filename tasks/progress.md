## Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Start with Task 001** - Set up the foundational project structure
2. **Follow the sequence** - Each task builds on previous ones
3. **Check dependencies** - Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed
4. **Update progress** - Mark tasks as completed when finished

### Task Completion Criteria
Each task includes specific acceptance criteria that must be met before marking as complete. Review the individual task files for detailed requirements.

### Quality Standards
- All code must pass linting and formatting checks
- Unit tests required for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Documentation must be updated for any API changes
- Security best practices must be followed

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **OpenAI API Integration**: External dependency that could affect recommendations
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization critical for search functionality
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication and authorization must be bulletproof

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement fallback mechanisms for external services
- Performance testing and optimization from early stages
- Security review and testing throughout development
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Response Times**: All endpoints < 500ms (cached < 100ms)
- **Uptime**: > 99% availability
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% code coverage
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of requests

### Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: Functional registration flow

- Use Docker for consistent development environment
- Set up proper environment variable management
- Implement hot reloading for development efficiency

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper logging throughout the application

### Performance Considerations
- Implement caching early in development
- Monitor database query performance
- Use proper indexing strategies
- Consider pagination for all list endpoints

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets to version control

**Last Updated:** August 23, 2025 (Rate Limiting Removed - All global and route-specific rate limiting removed to resolve 429 errors)  
**Next Review:** After completion of each phase  
**Project Manager:** Divyesh Kothwala  
**Repository:** [GitHub - divyeshkothwala-talentica/be-review-platform](https://github.com/divyeshkothwala-talentica/be-review-platform)

## Recent Changes (August 23, 2025)

### Rate Limiting Removal
- **Issue:** Users experiencing 429 "Too Many Requests" errors on all API endpoints
- **Root Cause:** Multiple rate limiting mechanisms were active:
  - Custom `authRateLimit` function in auth middleware
  - Rate limiting applied to auth routes (login, register, password change, validate)
  - Rate limiting on user profile routes
  - Rate limiting on review routes
  - Rate limiting on recommendation routes
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Removed `authRateLimit` function from auth middleware
  - Removed all rate limiting imports and usage from auth routes
  - Removed rate limiting from user profile routes
  - Removed rate limiting from review routes  
  - Removed rate limiting from recommendation routes
  - Rebuilt and redeployed backend with updated code
- **Status:** ✅ Completed - Rate limiting successfully removed from all endpoints
- **Testing:** Backend responds with proper validation errors instead of 429 rate limit errors
