# Task 001: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Overview
Set up the foundational project structure, development environment, and basic infrastructure for the Book Review Platform API.

## Scope
- Project initialization and structure
- Development environment setup
- Basic server configuration
- Environment management
- Development tools and scripts

## Deliverables

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Initialize Node.js project with package.json
- Create folder structure:
  ```
  backend/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── controllers/
  │   ├── models/
  │   ├── routes/
  │   ├── middleware/
  │   ├── services/
  │   ├── utils/
  │   └── config/
  ├── tests/
  ├── docs/
  └── scripts/
  ```
- Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Create .gitignore file

### 2. Core Dependencies Installation
- Express.js framework
- TypeScript and @types packages
- Development tools (nodemon, ts-node)
- Testing framework (Jest)
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)

### 3. Basic Server Setup
- Create main application entry point (app.ts)
- Set up Express server with basic middleware
- Configure CORS settings
- Add request logging middleware
- Set up basic health check endpoint

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Create environment variable management
- Set up different environments (development, staging, production)
- Configure environment-specific settings
- Create .env.example file

### 5. Development Scripts
- npm/yarn scripts for development
- Build and start scripts
- Testing scripts
- Linting and formatting scripts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project structure is created and organized
- [ ] All core dependencies are installed and configured
- [ ] Basic Express server runs without errors
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Development scripts work correctly
- [ ] Code quality tools are set up and functional
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK

## Dependencies
- None (foundational task)

## Estimated Time
4-6 hours

## Notes
- This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent development
- Ensure TypeScript is properly configured for strict type checking
- Set up proper logging from the beginning
- Consider Docker setup for consistent development environment
