# Task 013: Deployment and Monitoring

## Overview
Set up production deployment infrastructure, monitoring, logging, and health checks to ensure reliable operation of the Book Review Platform API.

## Scope
- Production deployment setup
- Environment configuration management
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Logging and observability
- Performance monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Deliverables

### 1. Production Environment Setup
- Cloud provider configuration (AWS/Railway/Vercel)
- Container deployment (Docker)
- Environment variable management
- SSL/TLS certificate setup
- Domain configuration
- Load balancer setup (if needed)

### 2. Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile example structure
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist/ ./dist/
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 3. Environment Configuration Management
- Production environment variables
- Secret management (API keys, database credentials)
- Configuration validation
- Environment-specific settings
- Secure credential storage

```typescript
// Environment configuration
const config = {
  development: {
    port: 5000,
    mongodb: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/bookreviews_dev',
    redis: 'redis://localhost:6379',
    logLevel: 'debug'
  },
  production: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 5000,
    mongodb: process.env.MONGODB_URI,
    redis: process.env.REDIS_URL,
    logLevel: 'info',
    ssl: true,
    trustProxy: true
  }
};
```

### 4. Health Check Implementation
- Application health endpoint
- Database connectivity check
- External service health checks
- Dependency status monitoring
- Health check aggregation

```typescript
// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const health = {
    status: 'OK',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    services: {
      database: await checkDatabaseHealth(),
      redis: await checkRedisHealth(),
      openai: await checkOpenAIHealth()
    },
    version: process.env.APP_VERSION
  };
  
  const isHealthy = Object.values(health.services)
    .every(service => service.status === 'OK');
  
  res.status(isHealthy ? 200 : 503).json(health);
});
```

### 5. Logging Infrastructure
- Structured logging implementation
- Log levels and categories
- Request/response logging
- Error logging and stack traces
- Performance logging
- Security event logging

```typescript
// Winston logger configuration
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  defaultMeta: { 
    service: 'book-review-api',
    version: process.env.APP_VERSION 
  },
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ 
      filename: 'logs/error.log', 
      level: 'error' 
    }),
    new winston.transports.File({ 
      filename: 'logs/combined.log' 
    }),
    new winston.transports.Console()
  ]
});
```

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Throughput monitoring
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource usage tracking (CPU, memory)
- Database performance monitoring
- Cache performance metrics

### 7. Application Metrics Collection
- Custom metrics implementation
- Business metrics tracking
- API usage analytics
- User behavior metrics
- System performance metrics

```typescript
// Prometheus metrics example
const promClient = require('prom-client');

const httpRequestDuration = new promClient.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status']
});

const activeConnections = new promClient.Gauge({
  name: 'active_connections',
  help: 'Number of active connections'
});

const databaseQueries = new promClient.Counter({
  name: 'database_queries_total',
  help: 'Total number of database queries',
  labelNames: ['operation', 'collection']
});
```

### 8. Alerting and Notification Setup
- Error rate alerts
- Response time alerts
- Resource usage alerts
- Service availability alerts
- Custom business metric alerts

### 9. Backup and Recovery Strategy
- Database backup automation
- Configuration backup
- Recovery procedures documentation
- Disaster recovery testing
- Data retention policies

### 10. Deployment Pipeline
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Automated testing in pipeline
- Build and deployment automation
- Rollback procedures
- Blue-green deployment strategy

## Monitoring Dashboard Configuration

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- **Application Health**: Uptime, response times, error rates
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network
- **Database**: Connection pool, query performance, storage
- **Cache**: Hit ratios, memory usage, eviction rates
- **External Services**: OpenAI API response times, failures
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, reviews created, recommendations generated

### Alert Thresholds:
```yaml
alerts:
  error_rate:
    threshold: 5%
    window: 5m
    severity: warning
  
  response_time:
    threshold: 1s
    percentile: 95th
    window: 5m
    severity: warning
  
  uptime:
    threshold: 99%
    window: 24h
    severity: critical
  
  database_connections:
    threshold: 80%
    severity: warning
  
  memory_usage:
    threshold: 85%
    severity: warning
```
